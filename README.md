# UniOfSalford-StudentWork-FinalYearProject
Final year project. Created a fake news detection system using machine learning and deep learning models.

Successfully trained and evaluated fake news detection models.

Attempted, but did not fully succeed in building a deployable web application.

Gained practical experience in ML, NLP, software engineering, and real-world problem-solving.

System Architecture:
Backend: training models
Frontend: Flask Web Server, Simple HTML form
Models Used:
Logistic Regression (fake_news_model.pkl)
DistilBERT model (bert_model)
APIs:
/predict (POST API)
/predict_form (Web Form)
Note: Full web application integration was unsuccessful!
